<p align="justify"> 
I received my B.Eng. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the University Malaysia Sarawak, and then pursued M.Sc. degree in electronic, communication, and computer engineering from the University of Nottingham, U.K., before completing my Ph.D in automatic control and system engineering from the University of Sheffield, U.K. I am currently a <strong>Senior Lecturer</strong> at the Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Malaysia Sabah and also the Head of the Electronic Engineering (Computer) Program. My research interests primarily focus on estimation theory and communication theory, with an emphasis on applying these theories to solve <strong>positioning and tracking problems in wireless networks</strong>, for which I received research grants from UMS and the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia.
